# Description
The solution contains 2 projects:
- `ScalaAnalyzer` - the analyzer library
- `Antlr_Scala` - example of library usage

The example contains all the code necessary to manipulate the operands/operations. You basically only need the `Operands` and `Operations` dictionaries of the `Analyzer` class.
